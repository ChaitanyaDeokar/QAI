Import Qiskit Libraries and IBM Quantum Widgets:

Import the necessary libraries from Qiskit, such as QuantumCircuit, Aer, execute, and visualization tools.
Import IBM Quantum Widgets for potential visualization within a Jupyter notebook.
Import Qiskit Runtime Service for later use.
Create a Quantum Circuit:

Create a quantum circuit named circuit with 16 quantum bits (qubits) and 16 classical bits (for measurement results).
Apply a Hadamard gate (h) to all 16 qubits. This operation creates superposition, putting each qubit in a state of 0 and 1 simultaneously.
Measure all 16 qubits and store the measurement results in the corresponding classical bits.
Visualize the Circuit:

Display the quantum circuit by printing it. This shows the operations and connections in the circuit.
Simulate the Circuit:

Use the Aer backend (simulator) to execute the quantum circuit with a single shot, meaning it's run once.
Retrieve the result of the simulation, which includes the counts of measurement outcomes.
Extract the random number from the counts by taking the keys of the counts dictionary (measurement outcomes), converting it to a binary representation, and then converting it to an integer.
Display the Random Number:

Print the random number in both decimal and binary representations.
Here's what's happening in summary:

The quantum circuit creates superposition using Hadamard gates.
It then measures the qubits to obtain a random binary number.
This binary number is then converted to both decimal and binary representations and displayed.
